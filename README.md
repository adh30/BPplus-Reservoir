# BPplus-Reservoir (*bpp_Res2*)
Reservoir analysis for BPplus files version 2 for BP+ and Pulsecor cardioscope files (\*.xml).
Matlab scripts to perform reservoir analysis, pressure-only wave intensity analysis and estimate some other hemodynamic parameters from non-invasive brachial blood pressure waveforms.

**This is the beta 5 version and hasn't been subjected to extensive testing. 

Some background on the reservoir-excess pressure analysis can be found in:

The method for wave intensity analysis is based on: 
* Alun Hughes, Chloe Park, Anenta Ramakrishnan, Jamil Mayet, Nish Chaturvedi, Kim Parker. Feasibility of estimation of aortic wave intensity using non-invasive pressure recordings in the absence of flow velocity in man.
Front. Physiol., 2020; 11: 550. https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00550

Much of this code was developed from original code by Kim Parker.
I am grateful to Richard Scott for information about variables in the BP plus XML file, identifying bugs and for code suggestions.
